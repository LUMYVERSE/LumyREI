### The Origin of LumyREI

Our modpack, **[COBBLEVERSE](https://modrinth.com/modpack/cobbleverse)**, utilizes **REI** as the primary recipe viewer.

With the introduction of new crafting mechanisms in Cobblemon 1.7+, specifically the new **Campfire Pot** and the **Brewing Stand** recipes, we quickly realized the need for a system that would allow our players to conveniently view these new recipes directly within the modpack. This eliminates the need to keep consulting external guides.

Therefore, we developed **LumyREI**: it is our in-house solution to ensure an intuitive crafting experience for all COBBLEVERSE players and the wider community.
